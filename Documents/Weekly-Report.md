### Weekly Report - Week of November 9, 2023
1. Introduction:
    - This week was the kick off of this project, this project was introduced to us on Monday the 6th of November by Franck. This project was to create a classic game in Assembly more precisly the game Pac-Man. At first we did a scrum meeting to anaylise the project, and then started working on different tasks taking in consideration each team members roles.
2. Accomplishments:
    - Our program manager did the functional specification.
    - As for the team member that is responsible for the Quality Assurence, he worked on a first version of the test plan.
    - The development team started off by working with the team members that were working on the funcational specification to create the concept of the game without starting developing it. Thinking of what we would like the include in the game and what should not be included in the game. In addition to that the development team started to read and try to understand how the Assembly language works with online documents but also the book that Franck has given to us mid of this week.
3. Challenges:
    - One of the first challenges was that we had to face as a team was to instal the apps that we all need, Lucas being the tech lead, has a macintosh devise and the rest of the team member having windows device. We are currently looking to find a solution.
4. Plans for Next Week:
    - We will start the technical specification.
    - Spread out all aspect with the technical leader and assign deadline for each task.
5. Conclusion:
    - To conclude this week, we are finishing off the tehcnical specification and worked on the test plan as soon as the Quality assurence and the Project manager has validated the functional specification we will go into the phase of development. This week as the kick off of the project meaning that we were all integrated into a new team then the previous project, meaning that we had to learn to work togther to assure a harmony in the team, getting to know the strenghts of each team member but also understanding their limits. To describe this week into a few words it would be: Productive, time optimising, team working, team building.
