## Project Name: [x86x16bits Retro-gaming]

## Project Overview


ALGOSUP asked us to recreate an old video game, which is the game called "Pac-Man" in an environment called MS-DOS (x86-16bits) and in assembly language [^1].

 So what is Pac-Man ?

>Pac-Man is a maze-based and a singleplayer video game set in a brightly colored, released in 1980 in Japan. The player takes control of a yellow character, known as Pac-Man. The objective of the game is to clear all the dots from the maze while avoiding four colorful ghosts who are out to catch Pac-Man. The player earns points by consuming dots and, occasionally, larger dots, which temporarily turn the ghosts vulnerable, then Pac-Man can eat them to earn more points.

### Project Purpose

This project provides to students a comprehensive learning experience, encompassing not only technical skills but also soft skills related to teamwork within special roles, project management, and problem-solving. It prepares students for real-world challenges in software development and can serve as a strong foundation for their programming careers.

### Project Goals

The students of Algosup are divided in eight team with a special role, each team have the same exercise to create the game Pac-Man in 16 bits assembly language with a provided environment called "MS-DOS" and its emulator "DOSBox".

### Project Scope


**Goals :**

- Recreate a game that makes people feel the joy of playing. 
- To define the core gameplay mechanics, rules, and objectives for the Pac-Man game, including the movement of the Pac-Man character, the behavior of ghosts and collecting pellets.
- To avoid all the copyright elements of the game like the yellow character sprite and his name : "Pac-Man", the ghost sprite and the soundtracks of the game. We need to change those elements. 
- To add some features as the difficulty and some sprites, to not just remake the game without changes (excepting the copyrights).
- To set performance goals, such as achieving a target frame rate and ensuring smooth gameplay.


#
**Non goals :**
- Make a game that is not pleasant to play. 
- To create the game that have another objective of the main game.
- To create the game in another language than assembly. 
- To develop the game that does not work/launch. 
- To deteriorate the ALGOSUP's ~~reputation~~.
