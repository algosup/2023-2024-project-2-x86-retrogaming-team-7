### 2. Overview


Our team get a task from Algosup, the objective is to create the game called "Pac-man" with assembly language [^1].

 So what is Pac-man ?

Pac-Man is a maze-based and a singleplayer video game set in a brightly colored. The player takes control of a round, yellow character, known as Pac-Man. The objective of the game is to clear all the dots from the maze while avoiding four colorful ghosts who are out to catch Pac-Man. The player earns points by consuming dots and, occasionally, larger dots, which temporarily turn the ghosts blue and vulnerable.

### 3. Project scope

The students of Algosup are divided in eight team with a special role, each team have the same exercise to create the game Pac-man in 16 bits assembly language with a provided 

The primary objectives of this project is to make the 


### 4. Goals and non goals

**Goals :**

- To define the core gameplay mechanics, rules, and objectives for the Pac-Man game, including the movement of the Pac-Man character, the behavior of ghosts and collecting pellets.
- To change all the copyright elements of the game like the yellow character sprite and his name : "Pac-man",  the ghost sprite and the musics of the game 
- To add some features as the difficulty and some sprites.
- To et performance goals, such as achieving a target frame rate and ensuring smooth gameplay.
- 

**Non goals :**
- To create the game that have another objective of the main game.
- To create the game in another language than assembly
- To develop the game up of his maximum (16)

### 10. Glossary


^1: Assembly language is a low-level programming language that is used to write programs for a computer's central processing unit (CPU). It is a human-readable representation of machine code, which is the binary code that a CPU can directly execute. Assembly language provides a symbolic way to represent the CPU's instructions, making it easier for programmers to write and understand low-level code while still having a one-to-one correspondence with the actual machine code.
