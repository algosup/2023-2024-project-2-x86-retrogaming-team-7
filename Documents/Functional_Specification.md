## Project Name: [x86x16bits Retro-gaming]

## Project Overview


ALGOSUP asked us to recreate an old video game, which is the game called "Pac-Man" in an environment called MS-DOS (x86-16bits) and in assembly language [^1].

 So what is Pac-Man ?

>Pac-Man is a maze-based and a singleplayer video game set in a brightly colored, released in 1980 in Japan. The player takes control of a yellow character, known as Pac-Man. The objective of the game is to clear all the dots from the maze while avoiding four colorful ghosts who are out to catch Pac-Man. The player earns points by consuming dots and, occasionally, larger dots, which temporarily turn the ghosts vulnerable, then Pac-Man can eat them to earn more points.

### Project Purpose

[Explain why the project is being undertaken and its overall objectives.]

Improve the students' skills of ALGOSUP with a low-level language...

### Project Goals

[List the specific goals and outcomes the project aims to achieve.]

The students of Algosup are divided in eight team with a special role, each team have the same exercise to create the game Pac-Man in 16 bits assembly language with a provided environment called "MS-DOS" and its emulator "DOSBox".

### Project Scope

[Define the boundaries and limitations of the project. What is included and what is excluded from the project scope?]

**Goals :**

- To define the core gameplay mechanics, rules, and objectives for the Pac-Man game, including the movement of the Pac-Man character, the behavior of ghosts and collecting pellets.
- To change all the copyright elements of the game like the yellow character sprite and his name : "Pac-Man",  the ghost sprite and the musics of the game 
- To add some features as the difficulty and some sprites.
- To set performance goals, such as achieving a target frame rate and ensuring smooth gameplay.
- 

**Non goals :**
- To create the game that have another objective of the main game.
- To create the game in another language than assembly
- To develop the game up of his maximum capacity which is 16 bits
- To deteriorate the public image of Algosup
