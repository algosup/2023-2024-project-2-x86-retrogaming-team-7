## Project Name: [x86x16bits Retro-gaming]

## Project Overview


ALGOSUP asked us to recreate an old video game, which is the game called "Pac-Man". We will make it with some features, in an environment called MS-DOS (x86-16bits) and in assembly language [^1].

 So what is Pac-Man ?

>Pac-Man is a maze-based and a singleplayer video game set in a brightly colored, released in 1980 in Japan. The player takes control of a yellow character, known as Pac-Man. The objective of the game is to clear all the dots from the maze while avoiding four colorful ghosts who are out to catch Pac-Man. The player earns points by consuming dots and, occasionally, larger dots, which temporarily turn the ghosts vulnerable, then Pac-Man can eat them to earn more points.

### Project Purpose

This project provides to students a comprehensive learning experience, encompassing not only technical skills but also soft skills related to teamwork within special roles, project management, and problem-solving. It prepares students for real-world challenges in software development and can serve as a strong foundation for their programming careers.

### Project Goals

The students of Algosup are divided in eight team with a special role, each team have the same exercise to create the game Pac-Man in 16 bits assembly language with a provided environment called "MS-DOS" and its emulator "DOSBox".

### Project Scope


**Goals :**

- Recreate a game that makes people feel the joy of playing. 
- To define the core gameplay mechanics, rules, and objectives for the Pac-Man game, including the movement of the Pac-Man character, the behavior of ghosts and collecting pellets.
- To avoid all the copyright elements of the game like the yellow character sprite and his name : "Pac-Man", the ghost sprite and the soundtracks of the game. We need to change those elements. 
- To add some features as the difficulty and some sprites, to not just remake the game without changes (excepting the copyrights).
- To set performance goals, such as achieving a target frame rate and ensuring smooth gameplay.


#
**Non goals :**
- Make a game that is not pleasant to play. 
- To create the game that have another objective of the main game.
- To create the game in another language than assembly. 
- To develop the game that does not work/launch. 
- To deteriorate the ALGOSUP's ~~reputation~~.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. x86-16bits environment

#### Description:

For this project we need to use the software DOSBox which is a simulator of a MS-DOS envrinonment.

#### Acceptance Criteria:

- Each system should be available to use this software for complete this project.

### 2. Pac-Man like

#### Description:

We need to create a game which contains the same mecanics of gameplay than the game Pac-Man, using new models and song due to copyright. 

#### Acceptance Criteria:

- The game must be complete with no issues, crash, bug or glitch during all the user experience.

## Non-Functional Requirements

This section should detail non-functional requirements, which include performance, security, usability, and other quality attributes.

### 1. Performance

#### [Performance Requirement Title]

- [Describe the performance requirement, such as response time, scalability, or throughput.]
- [E.g., "The system should be able to handle 100 concurrent users with response times under 2 seconds."]

### 2. Security

#### [Security Requirement Title]

- [Describe the security requirements, such as authentication, authorization, encryption, and data protection.]
- [E.g., "User passwords must be securely hashed and stored in the database."]

### [Continue listing non-functional requirements...]

## Data Model

Provide a data model or database schema, including tables, fields, and relationships, if applicable.

## User Interface

Describe the user interface design and layout, including wireframes or mockups if available.

## Use Cases

Provide use case diagrams and descriptions to illustrate how users will interact with the system.

## Assumptions and Constraints

List any assumptions and constraints that may impact the project's development and implementation.

## Dependencies

Identify any external dependencies that the project relies on, such as third-party APIs, libraries, or hardware.

## Risks
