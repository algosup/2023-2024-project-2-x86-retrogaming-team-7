Implement a pause menu accessible during gameplay, allowing players to resume, restart, or exit the game. Clear navigation options and visual indicators will guide users through menu interactions.

#### 8.5.3 Game Over Screen
Create an engaging game over screen that displays the final score, encourages replay, and provides options for restarting or returning to the main menu.

### 8.6 Accessibility Considerations

#### 8.6.1 Textual Feedback
Ensure critical information is also presented as text on-screen for players with visual impairments. This includes score updates, life count, and any in-game messages.

#### 8.6.2 Keyboard Navigation
Design the user interface to be navigable using keyboard controls for players who may have difficulty using a mouse. Clearly indicate focus and provide auditory cues for menu navigation.

This detailed user interface design plan outlines the layout, controls, visual and audio feedback, menu screens, and accessibility considerations for the Pac-Man game. It aims to create an immersive and enjoyable gaming experience for players of varying preferences and abilities.


## 9. Game Logic and Mechanics

### 9.1 Pac-Man Movement

#### 9.1.1 Grid-Based Movement
Pac-Man's movement will adhere to the grid, allowing him to traverse the maze cell by cell. This ensures precise and predictable movement, aligning with the classic Pac-Man gameplay.

#### 9.1.2 Directional Constraints
Implement directional constraints to prevent Pac-Man from moving through walls or outside the boundaries of the maze. This ensures that player input only influences valid movements within the game environment.

### 9.2 Pellets and Power-Ups

#### 9.2.1 Pellet Consumption
Define the rules for Pac-Man consuming pellets as he moves through the maze. Each pellet consumed contributes to the player's score. Special considerations for different types of pellets, such as regular pellets and larger power pellets, will be implemented.

#### 9.2.2 Power-Up Effects
When Pac-Man consumes a power pellet, ghosts will enter a vulnerable state, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for additional points. Implement a timer to limit the duration of the power-up effect, after which ghosts revert to their normal state.

### 9.3 Ghost Behavior

#### 9.3.1 Patrol and Chase Modes
Define patrol and chase modes for ghosts, creating dynamic and challenging enemy behavior. In patrol mode, ghosts follow predefined paths, while in chase mode, they actively pursue Pac-Man. Alternating between these modes adds strategic depth to the game.

#### 9.3.2 Ghost Movement Algorithms
Implement different movement algorithms for each ghost, providing distinct personalities and strategies. Algorithms may include pursuit, random movement, or a combination, enhancing the variety and complexity of ghost behavior.

### 9.4 Game Over Conditions

#### 9.4.1 Lives and Respawns
Pac-Man starts with a set number of lives, and one life is deducted upon collision with a ghost. Implement respawning mechanics to bring Pac-Man back to the starting position with a brief invincibility period after losing a life.

#### 9.4.2 Game Over Screen
Trigger the game over screen when Pac-Man runs out of lives. Display the final score, encourage replay, and provide options to restart the game or return to the main menu.

### 9.5 Scoring System

#### 9.5.1 Point Values
Assign point values for various in-game actions, such as eating pellets, consuming ghosts, and completing levels. Define a scoring system that rewards skillful gameplay and strategic decision-making.

#### 9.5.2 Level Progression
Outline the conditions for progressing to the next level. This may involve clearing all pellets from the maze or reaching a target score. Gradually increase the game's difficulty with each successive level.

### 9.6 Game Progression

#### 9.6.1 Level Transitions
Smoothly transition between levels, updating the maze layout and increasing the complexity of ghost behavior. Communicate level transitions to the player through on-screen notifications or visual cues.

#### 9.6.2 Game Completion
Define the criteria for completing the game, such as reaching a specific number of levels or achieving a target overall score. Celebrate the player's success and provide options for replay or returning to the main menu.

This comprehensive overview of game logic and mechanics outlines the core elements of Pac-Man's movement, pellet consumption, ghost AI behavior, game over conditions, scoring, and game progression. Implementing these mechanics will contribute to an engaging and authentic Pac-Man experience for players.

## 10. Documentation

### 10.1 Code Comments
