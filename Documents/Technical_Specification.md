## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline the technical details for the development of a Pac-Man game in Assembly language using DOSBox and NASM.

### 1.2 Scope
The Pac-Man game will be a classic implementation with a focus on low-level programming in Assembly for x86 architecture. The game will run in a DOS environment and will be developed using NASM (Netwide Assembler).

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 High-Level Overview
Provide a high-level overview of the system architecture. Describe the interaction between different components, such as the game engine, graphics, input handling, and game logic.

### 2.2 Block Diagram [Insert Block Diagram]
Include a block diagram illustrating the major components and their interconnections in the Pac-Man game.

## 3. Game Components

### 3.1 Game Engine
Describe the game engine responsible for managing game state, rendering graphics, and handling user input.

### 3.2 Graphics [Insert Graphics Architecture Diagram]
Explain the graphics subsystem, detailing how the game's visuals will be rendered. Include a graphics architecture diagram.

### 3.3 Input Handling
Explain how user input will be captured and processed to control Pac-Man's movements.

### 3.4 Game Logic
Detail the algorithms and logic governing Pac-Man's behavior, ghost movement, scoring, and level progression.

## 4. Assembly Language and NASM

### 4.1 Choice of Assembly Language
Specify the choice of Assembly language (e.g., x86 Assembly) and justify the selection.

### 4.2 NASM Assembly
Outline how NASM (Netwide Assembler) will be used for assembling and linking the code. Include any specific NASM directives or settings.

## 5. Development Environment

### 5.1 DOS Environment
Specify the DOS environment and version to be used for running the Pac-Man game.

### 5.2 DOSBox Configuration [Insert DOSBox Configuration Settings]
Provide configuration settings for DOSBox to ensure optimal performance and compatibility.

## 6. Testing and Debugging

### 6.1 Unit Testing
Detail the unit testing approach for individual components of the game.

### 6.2 Integration Testing
Outline the strategy for integrating different components and testing their interactions.

### 6.3 Debugging Tools
Specify the debugging tools and techniques to be used during development.

## 7. Performance Considerations

### 7.1 Optimization Strategies
Describe strategies for optimizing the game's performance in terms of graphics rendering and overall responsiveness.

### 7.2 Resource Usage
Provide an estimate of resource usage, such as memory and CPU utilization, and any considerations for efficient resource management.

## 8. Security Considerations

### 8.1 Input Validation
Explain how user input will be validated to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.

## 9. User Interface

### 9.1 Game Display
Describe the layout and design of the game screen, including score display, level information, and any other relevant details.

### 9.2 Controls
List and explain the keyboard controls for playing the Pac-Man game.

## 10. Documentation

### 10.1 Code Documentation
Specify the documentation standards to be followed for in-code comments and external documentation.

### 10.2 User Manual
Outline the content and structure of the user manual, including installation instructions and gameplay guidelines.

## 11. Future Enhancements

List potential future enhancements or features that could be added to the Pac-Man game in subsequent iterations.

## 12. Conclusion

Summarize the key points of the technical specification and highlight the goals and expectations for the development of the Pac-Man game.
