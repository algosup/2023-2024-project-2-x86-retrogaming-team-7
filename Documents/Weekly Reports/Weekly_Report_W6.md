# Weekly Report of Team 7
## Weekly Report - Week of December 11, 2023
1. Introduction:

This week we manage to achives most of tasks we needeed to do for the week but we have after a brainstorm we conclude that the project will not be complete with all features we wanted to make. 

2. Accomplishments:
- Implementation of Pac-Man's collision with walls
- Implementation of the tunnel to make Pac-Man and ghosts cross the map
- Implementation of the four ghosts
- Implementation of ghosts' collisions with walls
3. Challenges:
- We do not manage to implement random mouvement for ghosts
4. Plans for Next Week:
- Finish the interface of the game
- Integrate points incrementation
- Fix the most possible bugs for a good delivery product
5. Conclusion:

In summary, this week marked significant progress in our project as we successfully tackled key tasks, including the implementation of Pac-Man's collision with walls, the creation of a tunnel enabling both Pac-Man and ghosts to traverse the map, and the successful incorporation of four distinct ghosts with corresponding collision functionalities. Despite these achievements, a post-brainstorming assessment revealed that the project will fall short of our original vision, mainly due to the unresolved challenge of implementing random movement for ghosts.

Looking ahead to the upcoming week, our strategic plans include finalizing the game interface, integrating a points incrementation system, and diligently addressing potential bugs to ensure a high-quality product upon delivery. While faced with the reality of incomplete features, the team remains committed to delivering a polished and functional game that showcases our accomplishments and addresses the challenges encountered thus far. The insights gained from this week's reflections will guide our efforts as we continue to refine and enhance the project in the pursuit of a successful outcome.
