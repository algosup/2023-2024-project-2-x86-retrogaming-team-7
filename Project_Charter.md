### I. Executive summary
<!-- **Executive summary:** This section provides a brief but comprehensive overview of the project, including its objectives, scope, planned schedule, and key takeaways. -->

Our team was assigned to rebuild a Pac-Man game in assembly language, the assembler required is NASM to provide an version runnable on MS-DOS environement based on x86-16bits. For a playable version on computeur we need to use DOSBox which are an emulator of MS-DOS environement working on Windows, iOS and Linux environement. 

### II. Project definition
<!-- **Project definition:** This section deepens the understanding of the project by providing information about the vision, objectives, scope, and deliverables of the project.     -->

#### 1. Vision 
To recreate a faithful and playable version of the Pac-Man game using assembly language for the MS-DOS environment, while ensuring a nostalgic gaming experience for players

#### 2. Objectives
Objectives define the specific outcomes the project aims to accomplish.
The mains objectives are :
- Release a stable version of the game
- Adding multiples sprites selectable in the session
- Adjustement with difficulty options
